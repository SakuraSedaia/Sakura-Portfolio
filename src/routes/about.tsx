        <p>
          I am a 22 year old CAD Technology College Student who has a passion
          for 3D Artistry and Website Development. I started working with 3D
          Rendering in early 2016 using Blender 2.75 with a friend of mine
          during Middle School, where I begun working with making 3D Minecraft
          Renders with Minecraft assets and skins.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent a few years only working in 3D until 2018 in my Freshman year
          in high school where I started learning the basics of HTML and CSS,
          and thus begun the infinite loop of reformatting my portfolio site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following High School, I begun working as an automotive mechanic after
          becoming burnt out on art and spending 2 years improving my skills as
          a technician before leaving the auto industry and beginning my degree
          towards Computer-Aided Design Technologies in the manufacturing field.
          About the same time I begun experimenting with the SolidJS Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it stands, I am still working on my degree and working on passion
          projects with SolidJS and Blender 3D on the side.
